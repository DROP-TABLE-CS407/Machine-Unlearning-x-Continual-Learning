    "# Replay based Class Inremental Learning (CIL) with PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers a simplified implementation of class incremental learning (CIL) using replay-based techniques. The goal of CIL is to learn a model that can incrementally learn new classes without forgetting the previously learned classes. In this notebook, we will use a replay-based technique to store and replay the data from the previous classes to prevent forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will use the following steps:\n",
    "Train base model on the first set of two classes e.g. 0 and 1 for 100 epochs utilising Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01 and momentum of 0.9.\n",
    "After training our base model, we will then store a subset of our data from the first two classes in a replay buffer, let $R_i$ be the replay buffer for class $i$ and $D_i$ be the training data for class $i$ up to that training step inclusive of all previous classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote: $R_i \\subseteq D_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "And: $D_i = \\cup_{x = 0}^{i}d_x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $d_x$ is the data for class $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. the replay buffer will only contain a variant subset of the data from the previous classes as opposed to all the data of that class which\n",
    "we can change to determine the effect of the replay buffer size on the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point onwards, we will incrementally train our model utilising Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) by training on the class and replaying the data from the previous classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will utilise a standard implementation of a ResNet18 CNN model with a single fully connected layer at the end to classify the images. The model will be trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class."
